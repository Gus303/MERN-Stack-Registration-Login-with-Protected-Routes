# MERN Stack Registration & Login with Protected Routes

This project demonstrates a full-stack authentication system built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It includes user registration, login, and protected routes that require authentication. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, while the frontend is built with React. Authentication is handled using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure secure access to protected resources.

## Features:
- **User Registration**: Create a new account with a secure password.
- **User Login**: Authenticate with email and password.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for secure user access.
- **Protected Routes**: Only authorized users can access certain parts of the application.
- **Error Handling**: Handles invalid credentials, server errors, and form validation.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
